## What is PlayFab?
PlayFab is a complete backend platform for live games with managed game services, real-time analytics, and LiveOps. 

PlayFab's backend services reduce the barriers to launch for game developers, offering both large and small studios cost-effective development solutions that scale with their games and help them engage, retain and monetize players. PlayFab enables developers to use the intelligent cloud to build and operate games, analyze gaming data and improve overall gaming experiences.

To use PlayFab features, you must sign up for a [PlayFab account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). The PlayFab documentation is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/).

## What is the purpose of this SDK?
This SDK provides complete access to the entire PlayFab API on Roblox. It supports both Lua and TypeScript (for [roblox-ts](http://roblox-ts.com/) users), using type declaration files.  I highly recommend using TypeScript with this project if you can. The entire PlayFab API is fully typed, and it makes working with the API a *lot* easier.

All SDK source files are generated automatically based on PlayFab's API schema, which makes updating to recent API updates incredible fast and gives less room for human error.
